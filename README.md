## About

awsm is a collection of helpers for doing awesome wasm in Rust

Currently:

* webgl: a barebones WebGL renderer a rebuild of [the typescript version](https://github.com/dakom/pure3d-typescript)
* gltf: a batteries included 3D renderer. Also a rebuild of [the typescript version](https://github.com/dakom/pure3d-typescript)
* loaders: web loaders -> futures
* dom: scattered dom helpers (requestAnimationFrame, onResize, etc.) 
* audio: todo!

## Status

Just the beginning, and learning Rust... come back in a year or so?

## Live Coding 

As a way to self-motivate getting over the learning curve (this is my first Rust project), I thought it might help to livestream the coding+learning sessions, and also archive them in a playlist for a look-back.

Here's the permalink to the live stream: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGKhwtFOUlzj4VILDU0efkQ/live
