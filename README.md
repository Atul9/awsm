Just the beginning, and learning Rust... come back in a year or so?

## About

awsm intends to be a collection of helpers for doing awesome wasm in Rust

Examples:

* webgl: a thin wrapper to make common rendering tasks easier
* gltf: a batteries included 3D renderer.
* loaders: web loaders -> futures
* dom: scattered dom helpers (requestAnimationFrame, onResize, etc.) 
* audio: also a thin wapper

## Live Coding 

As a way to self-motivate getting over the learning curve (this is my first Rust project), I thought it might help to livestream the coding+learning sessions, and also archive them in a playlist for a look-back.
